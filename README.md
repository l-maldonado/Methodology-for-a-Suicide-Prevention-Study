# Suicide Risk Analysis and Prevention for Discharged Mental Health Patients

Project Summary: Suicide Risk Analysis and Prevention for Discharged Mental Health Patients

This research project aims to analyze and predict suicide risk within one year after discharge among patients diagnosed with mental disorders. The focus is on leveraging Big Data technologies, machine learning models, and neural networks to identify key risk factors and propose effective preventive measures in the public mental healthcare domain.

The project is divided into four key objectives:

    Data Management Assessment: A thorough review of existing research articles, evaluating methodologies and data sources, with a focus on suicide risk among discharged mental health patients.
    Big Data System Analysis: An exploration of Big Data systems and architectures to handle large datasets, identifying risk factors, and providing actionable insights for suicide prevention.
    Big Data Environment Evaluation: Assessing various Big Data platforms for their ability to manage, retrieve, and process large dynamic datasets efficiently, with an emphasis on scalability and processing speed.
    Neural Network Exploration: Analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of different neural network types to determine the most suitable model for predicting suicide risk in the context of mental health care.

The project is guided by the Waterfall methodology for structured data preparation phases and the Agile methodology for iterative tasks like data cleansing and neural network experimentation. The CRISP-DM framework is employed for data mining and predictive modeling, given its robustness in handling complex data analytics projects.

The research tackles four main questions regarding the statistical significance of suicide risk factors, the role of demographic and clinical indicators, the impact of treatment and follow-up care, and the effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting suicide risk.

Data for the project is gathered from the OECD, which provides detailed statistics on suicide within one year after discharge among mental health patients across 19 countries. The data includes demographic, clinical, and psychosocial factors that are analyzed to uncover risk patterns.

Despite the project's complexity and the challenges posed by its large scope, the research has yielded valuable insights into the risk factors for suicide among discharged mental health patients, including the significant role of treatment adherence, psychiatric comorbidities, and socio-economic factors. However, the project's full objectives were not achievable within the given timeframe, leading to a shift in focus towards designing a comprehensive research framework and laying the groundwork for future studies.

This project ultimately seeks to develop evidence-based strategies to mitigate suicide risk and improve post-discharge care for mental health patients, using data-driven approaches and machine learning technologies.

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting suicide risk within one year after discharge among patients diagnosed with mental disorders. The research addresses several key objectives related to data management, Big Data technologies, neural networks, and predictive modeling, ultimately aiming to develop a framework for suicide prevention in the public healthcare domain.

## Objectives

### Objective 1: Assessing Data Storage and Management Requirements

The project will review a set of research articles evaluating the methodologies and data sources used in suicide prevention studies. It will focus on analyzing publications from a range of years and geographic regions to create a comprehensive overview of existing research on suicide risk among discharged mental health patients.

### Objective 2: Analyzing Big Data Systems for Suicide Prevention Insights

We aim to explore the design concepts, architectural patterns, and technology stacks required to analyze large datasets in the context of suicide prevention. The goal is to identify and quantify key risk factors associated with suicide, providing actionable insights for healthcare providers and policymakers.

### Objective 3: Evaluating Big Data Environments

A comprehensive evaluation will be conducted to identify a Big Data environment capable of efficiently managing and processing large, dynamic datasets. This will focus on scalability, processing speed, and data retrieval mechanisms tailored to suicide prevention efforts in the mental healthcare system.

### Objective 4: Exploring Neural Networks for Suicide Risk Prediction

The project will investigate the practical applications, strengths, and weaknesses of various neural network architectures. The aim is to determine the most suitable neural network type for predicting suicide risk among discharged mental health patients.

## Project Management Framework

The **Waterfall** approach is selected for structured phases such as data preparation, ensuring compliance with healthcare regulations, and handling sensitive data. For dynamic phases like data cleansing and neural network experimentation, the **Agile** approach will be used to allow flexibility, rapid development, and iterative collaboration between data scientists and healthcare experts.

## Data Science Framework: CRISP-DM

The **Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)** framework was chosen due to its strong alignment with data mining and predictive modeling, which are key components of this project. CRISP-DM provides a clear roadmap to tackle complex analytics challenges, especially in the healthcare sector, where the data is vast and multifaceted.

## Research Questions

The project will address four main research questions:

1. **Suicide Risk Among Mental Disorder Patients:** Are there statistically significant differences in suicide risk between patients with different mental disorders, and can these differences guide targeted interventions?

2. **Risk Factors:** What are the key factors, including demographic variables, that contribute to the risk of suicide within one year after discharge among patients diagnosed with mental disorders?

3. **Impact of Clinical and Psychosocial Factors:** How do clinical and psychosocial features (e.g., psychiatric comorbidity, treatment adherence, follow-up care) affect suicide risk after discharge?

4. **Machine Learning for Suicide Prediction:** Can machine learning models predict the risk of suicide among discharged mental health patients, and which models are most effective?

## Data Gathering and Preparation

Datasets used in this project were gathered from the **Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)**. These datasets include information from 19 countries regarding suicide risk among patients with mental disorders. The data is available in XML format and includes a data dictionary to guide interpretation and data analysis. The dataset is available at https://stats.oecd.org/

## Discussion

Our analysis highlights several critical insights:

- **Demographics:** Middle-aged men are at a higher risk of suicide within one year after discharge.
- **Disorder Severity:** Patients with severe mood disorders are more likely to experience suicidal ideation or attempts.
- **Treatment Adherence:** While insufficient data on treatment is available, adherence to treatment and post-discharge follow-up care are crucial to suicide prevention.
- **Temporal Risk:** The first three months after discharge represent a particularly high-risk period for patients.
- **Social Determinants:** Family support and occupational status may correlate with a lower suicide risk. However, further research is needed to investigate geographic disparities.

Despite the complexity of this project, we have made significant progress in detailing the necessary research requirements, dataset specifications, and methods to continue pursuing this initiative.

## Specific Requirements and Assessments for Data Retrieval and Processing

Due to the complexity of the project, several specific requirements and assessments are necessary to ensure feasibility within the given budget and scope:

- **Data Collection:** Secure access to sensitive healthcare data, including patient information, via APIs or partnerships with institutions.
- **Data Compliance:** Ensuring compliance with healthcare data regulations, such as HIPAA, GDPR, or other local laws.
- **Big Data Architecture:** Selecting and setting up a Big Data infrastructure to handle large, dynamic datasets efficiently.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Identifying and testing machine learning models that can predict suicide risk, ensuring data quality and scalability for future analysis.

## Conclusion

While this project faced significant challenges due to its scale and complexity, it provides valuable insights into the suicide risks associated with mental health patients post-discharge. Moving forward, it is crucial to focus on improving data gathering methods, refining machine learning models, and exploring collaborative efforts to address the larger public health issue of suicide prevention.

We aim to develop a detailed plan for the future stages of this project, including dataset gathering, methodology selection, and predictive model evaluation.

Discussion
The analysis of patients diagnosed with mental disorders has yielded critical insights.
Notably, specific demographic groups, particularly middle-aged men, exhibit a heightened
suicide risk within one year of discharge. Moreover, patients with severe mood disorders
demonstrate an increased susceptibility to suicidal ideation or attempts.
Regarding treatment, the current analysis refrains from discussion due to insufficient data, as
it falls outside the scope of this study's objectives. Nonetheless, the pursuit of treatment
adherence emerges as a pivotal factor, underscoring the necessity for continual support and
post-discharge follow-up care.
Temporal analysis reveals that the initial three months post-discharge carry a particularly
elevated risk, demanding enhanced support and follow-up procedures.
Social determinants, such as family support and occupational status, may potentially correlate
with reduced risk. However, discernible geographic disparities in suicide rates warrant
in-depth investigation.
Recommendations for improving this project
● Bias and Fairness: Beware of the potential impact of many biasing factors (in the
collection and interpretation of the data, and in the extraction of conclusions) by
making bias audits and fairness-aware machine learning.
● Patient engagement: Engage patients in their care by providing them with personalized
insights and recommendations based on model predictions.
●
Inclusion of Benefits: Collaboration with mental health professionals is essential to
validate model results and ensure appropriate interventions are implemented.
● There was not enough time to master the required technologies. A not comprehensive
list of the technology stack components that would be desirable is in the Annex 3.

This is a very complex project that exceeds the timeframe available. In the construction of the desired system, considering that it may involve gathering sensitive private data, connecting to protected APIs and negotiating agreements with institutions, there is a set of requirements and assessments needed to ensure that the project is feasible in the budget and scope required. Each of the items in this list may
involve so much detail that they may be projects in itself
